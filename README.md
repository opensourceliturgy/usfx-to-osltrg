# usfx-to-osltrg
A utility to convert Bibles from USFX format to the format used in this Open Source Liturgy project.

It should be noted - the special internal format for scripture used by
this Open Source liturgy project is not intended to replace
__usfx__.
Rather, it is an format for scripture that is easily-digested by
the scripts at run-time.
However, if someone wishes to maintain a repository of different
Bibles to use with the Open Source liturgy software, the format
that those Bibles should be in should still be __usfx__.

The internal formate used in this Open Source liturgy project
is not designed for the purpose of interchange, but for the
purpose of easy internal access.
